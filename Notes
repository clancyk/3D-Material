Today's Thoughts/Progress:
Decided to focus on only 7 properties since they have the most information on all materials. This eliminates my colour problem 
(no longer need to figure out how to apply the colourmap to each material - but should for future). But I need to figure out
how to then only ask for those columns in dataframe. This shouldn't be too hard but I just need to remember the syntax.
