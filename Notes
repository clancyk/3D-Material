Today's Thoughts/Progress:
Decided to focus on only 7 properties since they have the most information on all materials. This eliminates my colour problem 
(no longer need to figure out how to apply the colourmap to each material - but should for future). But I need to figure out
how to then only ask for those columns in dataframe. This shouldn't be too hard but I just need to remember the syntax.

I think the problem is that the 'yticks' is not a list (and instead changed it to be an array). I need to remember how to make
a list comprehension to call the information in the dataframe. I have remembered how to call the rows of a dataframe but got
the error "'str' object is not callable" when used: yticks = [num(0) for num in data.iloc[0]]. I looked up what data.iloc[0] 
is and it is all the information for that one row. Hence I have called the wrong thing (called the first row instead of first
column, which now writing it out makes sense! I want all the rows in the first column). data[0] is not right either ;) For 
calling a column you need to use the column label, so data['Company'] in this case. I got the same error "'str' object is not 
callable", so maybe this iteration is not allowed.
Fixed that previous problem by just creating the list (0-52) another way: yticks = [0]+[1]*52

New thing: why does ys have two instances of NAN for the hardness values if I've changed the data frame to replace all
instances of NAN to 0? Is that what is wrong?
