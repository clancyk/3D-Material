Notes and ramblings to myself.

Today's Thoughts/Progress:
Decided to focus on only 7 properties since they have the most information on all materials. This eliminates my colour problem 
(no longer need to figure out how to apply the colourmap to each material - but should for future). But I need to figure out
how to then only ask for those columns in dataframe. This shouldn't be too hard but I just need to remember the syntax.

I think the problem is that the 'yticks' is not a list (and instead changed it to be an array). I need to remember how to make
a list comprehension to call the information in the dataframe. I have remembered how to call the rows of a dataframe but got
the error "'str' object is not callable" when used: yticks = [num(0) for num in data.iloc[0]]. I looked up what data.iloc[0] 
is and it is all the information for that one row. Hence I have called the wrong thing (called the first row instead of first
column, which now writing it out makes sense! I want all the rows in the first column). data[0] is not right either ;) For 
calling a column you need to use the column label, so data['Company'] in this case. I got the same error "'str' object is not 
callable", so maybe this iteration is not allowed.
Fixed that previous problem by just creating the list (0-52) another way: yticks = [0]+[1]*52

New thing: why does ys have two instances of NAN for the hardness values if I've changed the data frame to replace all
instances of NAN to 0? Is that what is wrong? 
YES! The 'ys' was calling the wrong column name for the hardness values! There was a space in the Excel file that wasn't there
when being called and therefore was giving the error. 

Figure was produced. This only has 2 data rows plotted and the xticks/yticks are all squished. Will need to next see why that 
happening!

And I'm back! Okay so today working on why the figure is only printing out 2 materials instead of all of them.

All the material properties seem to be displaying correctly. There are 8, just like I wanted and all the values seem to 
correspond correctly to how high they should be (it isn't a good graph for comparison really but will work on that later!)

The 2 materials plotted are not material 1 and 2 in the excel document based on the plotted values. Figured it out! I forgot
my BEDMAS, yticks = [0]+[1]*52 will plot [0] and [52]. Actually, looking at yticks it is [0,1,1,1,1,1....etc]. So it was 
making 52 instances of [1] and then adding this to [0]. So it should have plotted row #2 several times. Why didn't it?

Also remembered simple range function to create lists so yticks = range(0,53). But this gives me an error when try to run the
program.
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'no break'
Ah ha! So in python 3 they changed the range function a bit, and the yticks was a 'range' type instead of a list. 
Info from Stackoverflow:
- range(0,3) returns a class of immutable iterable objects that lets you iterate over them, it does not produce lists, and they 
  do not store all the elements in the range in memory, instead they produce the elements on the fly (as you are iterating over 
  them) , whereas list(range(0,3)) produces a list (by iterating over all the elements and appending to the list internally).
Okay so changing yticks to a list didn't solve the problem. Need to understand error more.
Library kicking me out! I am looked at the yticks 'list' and it is outputting as like one column. I am not sure if this is 
the problem. Next time look up how to transpose/alter the list and see if it is the problem. The error is talking about zs
which comes from k, derived from yticks to it must do with yticks.
